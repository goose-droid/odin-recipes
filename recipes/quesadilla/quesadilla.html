        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Two tortillas</li>
            <li>Grated Cheese</li>
            <li>A scoop each of salsa, sour cream, and guacamole.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the first tortilla in a large shallow pan, and turn the stove on medium until underside is golden or light brown.</li>
            <li>Set aside the frist tortilla (having only cooked one side), and do the same thing to the second tortilla.</li>
            <li>Flip the second tortilla and lower the heat.</li>
            <li>Put cheese onto the second tortilla, then place the first tortilla on top, making sure to put the golden or brown side down.</li>
            <li>Keep on heat until the cheese has melted enough to flip the quesadilla without making a mess.</li>
            <li>Flip the quesadilla, and keep it on heat long enough to melt the rest of the chease and gild the back of the tortilla.</li>
            <li>Place finished quesadilla on a plate, slice it into triangles, and scoop the salsa, sour cream, and guacamole onto it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
